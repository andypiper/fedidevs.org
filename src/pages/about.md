Fedi Docs aims to be a comprehensive resource for those looking to build software that federate with ActivityPub powered services on the Fediverse.

By discussing only the applicable Actions and Objects that are required for each service, and giving examples of what they send out in return it should simplify the act of building software that is compatible with the Fediverse.
