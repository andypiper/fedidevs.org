title: "Announcement: Online meeting on March 7, 2024, focused on FediTest"
---

Coordinates:

* March 7, 2024
* 11am to 12noon pacific time (19:00 to 20:00 UTC)
* Online at https://meet.jit.si/fedidevs
* Everybody interested in developing for the Fediverse is invited!

[Andy Piper (@andypiper@macaw.social)](https://macaw.social/@andypiper) and [Johannes Ernst (@j12@social.coop)](https://social.coop/@j12t) will be hosting this call.

Agenda:

* Main focus will be an early show-and-tell of [FediTest](https://feditest.org), a project to create a test suite for the Fediverse protocol stack. Johannes will demo the first running code, explain the architecture and key abstractions as they currently are, some early tests and integrations with WordPress+AP and Mastodon. The eventual goal of the project is to be able to easily run the various Fediverse server-side applications against each other (say, WordPress+AP against Mastodon) with high test coverage across the entire protocol stack. He wants your feedback and understand how to best meet your needs when testing your implementation against other applications. (40min)

* In the past, we've had 5-min ad-hoc show-and-tells that people really liked. If you have something cool to show off that may be of interest to other developers -- running code preferred -- grab the mic and tell us! (20min)

Hopefully this call will be the first in a long line of resumed calls.
